# These are the default config values.
# Since this module supports config layering, you don't need to copy every line; only the [stanza] and lines that you want to add or override.
# Therefore, for example, /opt/splunk/etc/apps/my_app/bin/config.ini will override values in /opt/splunk/etc/apps/my_app/bin/splunk_rest/config.ini (this file).
